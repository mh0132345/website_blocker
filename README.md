# Website_blocker
A simple Python program to block some websites by redirecting in the hosts file.
You may want to backup hosts file.
# Add a website to block
Add a new line with the link of website to `block.txt` file.
# Run the program at the start up
## For Window
You may want the program run in the background.

To do that, change the extension from `py` to `pyw`. It means the file name is changed to `website_blocker.pyw`.

And also, you need to change the path in the program to your full path to run on task scheduler.

Then you can put it on task scheduler of Windows to run the program at start up time.
